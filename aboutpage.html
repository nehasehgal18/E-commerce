        Hi Homies ! <br>

        Thank you for visiting our site and want to get to know more about us. Best Shopping Center comes out of my
        passion for creativity, my love for Nature and the belief there is room to improve and help each other as a
        society. As former Project Manager and Blogger, I saw the lack of support some budding designers and artisans
        were getting and how wasteful the fast fashion industry was and decided to act upon it. I realized too that when
        you want to dress with a conscience, the options are all scattered around. 

        At Best shopping center you will find designers and brands that embrace at least one of our 3 S's: Slow Fashion
        (not mass produced items), Sustainability and Social Responsibility. This is what I call Sustainable Style.

        We believe there is another way to enjoy fashion in your own terms. Out of the frenzy of the 52 seasons and
        non-stop collections the big brands are trying to sell. The fashion industry is the second biggest pollutant in
        the world. Not only that, most of the workers in this industry are not having decent working conditions or
        proper pay. It is no joke. And individually we can help break that circle by simply being more conscious of what
        we are buying and who is behind each of our garments.

        The name is coming out of mixing Go + Shop + Utopia. It might be a utopia but I think we can shop in a more
        responsible way and have a positive impact while doing it.

        We believe in quality, in things well done, even if they take longer to be produced. We believe in products that
        will last a lifetime and can become a heritage piece. Our designers work with artisans, craftsmen or they are themselves developing their own products. Imagine how much love goes into each of the pieces you are seeing here!

        We support design and innovation because creativity needs to be nurtured and there is no Planet B. Here you will
        only find exclusive luxury products that support the local economy, respect Mother Nature and exude quality and
        design. Nothing less, nothing more.<br>

        Thanks for joining us on this new sustainable journey. &#128151 <br>

        Founder of Best Shopping Center
